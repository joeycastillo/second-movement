/** @addtogroup rtc Real-Time Clock
  * @brief This section covers functions related to the SAM L22's real-time clock peripheral, including
  *        date, time and alarm functions.
  * @details The real-time clock is the only peripheral that main.c enables for you. It is the cornerstone
  *          of low power operation on the watch, and it is required for several key functions that we
  *          assume will be available, namely waking on a press of the ALARM button. It is also required
  *          for the operation of the 1 Hz tick interrupt, which we use to wake from STANDBY mode.

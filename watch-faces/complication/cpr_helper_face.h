/*
 * This watchface is intended for professional healthcare providers!
 *
 * This watchface is designed to be a tracker for an emergency situation when performing cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and performing Advanced Life Support (ALS).
 * It tracks the time and duration of the CPR, number of defibrillations and administration of adrenaline/epinephrine.
 * It also sounds an alarm every 4 minutes as a reminder for adrenaline administration in accordance with the 2021 European Resuscitation Guidelines to give adrenaline every 3-5 minutes.
 * 
 * At the moment it's working best with the custom LCD.
 * The classic LCD has a few limitations for displaying numbers in the top row. So the display for shock count and adrenaline count is different and timestamps are displayed without seconds. Differences to the custom LCD are written in [***].
 *
 * USAGE:
 * - The first screen encountered when switching to the watchface is the timer screen. Here you can find the timer (bottom row), the counter for defibrillations ("shock-counter" -> upper left/[upper right]) and the counter for administered adrenaline ("adrenaline-counter" -> upper right/[bottom right]).
 * - The timer is started by long-pressing the ALARM button. The timer is configured to show minutes on the left and seconds on the right. It doesn't show hours. The minutes go up to 199 and the seconds to 59.
 * - When the timer is running the shock-counter or adrenaline-counter are increased by short pressing the LIGHT button or ALARM button respectively.
 * - When increasing the each counter the LED is flashed as a visualisation. The colors can be changed in the settings menu. The colors depend on the version of SensorWatch. Green and red boards have red and green LEDs. Blue boards have red and blue LEds. Pro boards have red, green and blue LEDs.
 * - The default colors for the pro and blue board are: shock = blue (4); adrenaline = red (4). For green and red board: shock = red (2), green (2); adrenaline = red (4).
 * - The timer is stopped by longâ€“pressing the ALARM button.
 * -
 * - When the timer is stopped it automatically switches to "review-mode" and displays the elapsed time. The timer can't be started if it was stopped. It has to be reset first.
 * - In review mode one can see the timestamps of the session. The first and last being when the timer was started and stopped. And inbetween are timestamps whenever an action was done (shock/adrenaline).
 * - The first timestamp (timer started) is marked by the LAP-Indicator. The last timestamp (timer stopped) is marked by the SLEEP indicator/[BELL-Indicator].
 * - Pressing the ALARM button advances through the timestamps. Pressing the LIGHT button switches between showing elapsed time (relative) with a maximum of 199:59 (MM:SS) and timestamps (absolute) with seconds (HH:MM:SS)/[no seconds] (HH:MM).
 * - Long-pressing the LIGHT button resets the timer, deletes all the timestamps and the LED is flashed green (4). Now the timer is ready again.
 * -
 * - When the timer is not running and there are no timestamps/is reset long-pressing the MODE button activates the settings mode to set the color of the "shock-LED" and "adrenaline-LED".
 * - There are 6 pages for the pro boards. 3 LED-settings (red, green, blue) for shock count illumination (Sh) and 3 LED-settings (red, green, blue) for adrenaline count illumination (Ad). Depending on the board only the relevant LEDs can be set.
 * - Pressing the LIGHT button switches between the pages. Pressing the ALARM button increases the intensity of the chosen LED (0-15). When settings the intensity the LEDs are activated while in the settings to see the resulting color.
 * - Long-pressing the MODE button activates the home screen (timer).
 * -
 * - Pressing the MODE button anywhere in this watchface switches to the next one.
 * - 
 * THANKS:
 * - To Wesley Ellis and Joey Castillo. I incorporated some of the code of the stopwatch_face for the timer.

/*
 * STOCK STOPWATCH face
 *
 * The Stock Stopwatch face implements the original F-91W stopwatch
 * functionality, including counting hundredths of seconds and lap timing.
 *
 * Use the ALARM button to start and stop the stopwatch.
 * Press the LIGHT button while the stopwatch is running to view the lap time.
 *  (The stopwatch continues running in the background, indicated by a blinking colon.)
 * Press the LIGHT button again to switch back to the running stopwatch.
 * Press the LIGHT button when the timekeeping is stopped to reset the stopwatch.
 *
 * There are two improvements compared to the original F-91W:
 *  o When the stopwatch reaches 59:59, the counter does not simply jump back
 *    to zero but keeps track of hours in the upper right-hand corner
 *    (up to 24 hours).
 *  o Long-press the light button to toggle the LED behavior.
 *    It either turns on with each button press or remains off.
 *
 * NOTE:
 * This watch face relies heavily on static vars in fast_stopwatch.c.
 * The disadvantage is that you cannot use more than one instance of this
 * watch face on your custom firmware - but then again, who would want that?
 * The advantage is that accessing vars is more direct and faster, and we
 * can save some precious cpu cycles.  :-)

/*
 * POMODORO TIMER face
 *
 * Heavily based on the COUNTDOWN face, this faces uses the same base to setup a
 * infinite cycle of a Pomodoro Timer for studying or concentration time.
 *
 * The Initial UI shows the letters POM (or PO in the classic screen) and the
 * numbers of the selected times for the pomodoro session. In the hours section
 * it shows the focus minutes, in the minutes shows the time for the breaks and
 * in the seconds it shows the time for the long break after 4 pomodoros.
 *
 * Buttons:
 * - A long press on the alarm button in this screen changes the minutes for the
 * session.
 * - Pressing the alarm button will initiate the timer with the chosen settings.
 * The words "focus" and "break" (or "FO" and "BR" in the classic screen) will
 * be shown in the screen to know which mode the timer is.
 * - When the timer is running a press in the alarm button will stop the timer.
 * - The light button will reset the face when the timer is stopped.
 *
 * Every time the timer finishes a beep will sound and the next timer will start
 * inmediatly.

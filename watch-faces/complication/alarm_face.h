/*
 * Alarm Face modeled after the module in the GW-M5610U.
 *
 * This face is a port of the alarm face that can be found on more advanced Casios,
 * with minor tweaks to make the UI work with 3 buttons instead of the typical 4.
 * 
 * In this face you can configure:
 * - 4 daily alarms
 * - 1 daily snooze alarm (will repeat 7 times at 5 minutes interval, unless the user enters the face)
 * - 1 hourly chime
 * 
 * Bonus feature unique to this implementation, the hourly chime can be set for minutes other than :00.
 *
 * Basic daily alarm clock face. Seems useful if nothing else in the interest
 * of feature parity with the F-91Wâ€™s OEM module, 593.

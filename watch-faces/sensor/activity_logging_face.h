/*
 * ACTIVITY LOGGING
 *
 * This watch face works with Movement's built-in tracking of accelerometer state to log activity over time.
 * The watch face shows the number of active minutes counted for each of the last 14 days. Layout:
 *
 *  - Top left is display title (ACT or AC for Activity)
 *  - Top right is the day of the month corresponding to the data point shown on screen.
 *  - Bottom row is the number of active minutes counted on the given day.
 *  - If the display is showing today's active minutes, the SIGNAL indicator is also energized, to remind you
 *    that the accelerometer sensor is sensing, and the watch face is still counting today's active minutes.
 *
 * A short press of the Alarm button moves backwards in the data log, showing yesterday's active minutes,
 * then the day before, etc. going back 14 days.
 * A short press of the Light button moves forward in the data log, looping around if we're on the most-recent day.
 * Holding the Light button will illuminate the display.
 *

/*
 * SETTINGS face (replaces old Preferences watch face)
 *
 * The Settings watch face allows you to configure various options on your
 * Sensor Watch. Like all other screens, you advance the field you’re setting
 * with the Light button, and advance its value with the Alarm button. The
 * Settings watch face labels each setting with a two-letter code up top
 * when using the classic LCD, or something more readable on the custom LCD.
 * The following list describes each setting and their options:
 *
 *  CL / Clock - Clock mode.
 *      This setting allows you to select a 12-or 24-hour clock display. All
 *      watch faces that support displaying the time will respect this setting;
 *      for example, both Simple Clock, World Clock and Sunrise/Sunset will
 *      display the time in 24 hour format if the 24 hour clock is selected here.
 *
 *  BT / BTN - Button beep.
 *      This setting allows you to choose whether the Mode button should emit
 *      a beep when pressed, and if so, how loud it should be. Options are
 *      "Y" for yes and "N" for no.
 *
 *  TO / Tmout - Timeout.
 *      Sets the time until screens that time out (like Settings and Time Set)
 *      snap back to the first screen. 60 seconds is a good default for the
 *      stock firmware, but if you choose a custom firmware with faces that
 *      you’d like to keep on screen for longer, you can set that here.
 *
 *  LE / LoEne - Low Energy mode.
 *      Sets the time until the watch enters its low energy sleep mode.
 *      Options range from 1 hour to 7 days, or Never. The more often Sensor
 *      Watch goes to sleep, the longer its battery will last — but you will
 *      lose the seconds indicator while it is asleep. This setting allows
 *      you to make a tradeoff between the device’s responsiveness and its
 *      longevity.
 *
 *  LT / LED - Light Duration and Color
 *      The first LED screen lets you choose how long the LED should stay lit
 *       when the LIGHT button is pressed. Options are 1 second, 3 seconds
 *       and 5 seconds, or “No LED” to disable the LED entirely.
 *      The remaining screens set the intensity of the red, green or blue LEDs
 *       depending on the target Sensor Board hardware to allow a custom color
 *       blend. Values range from 0 (off) to 15 (full intensity).
 *      On the LED color screens, the LED remains on so that you can see the
 *      effect of mixing the LED colors.
